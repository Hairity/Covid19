#COVID-19 tracker

A little app I made to play around with React, API and graphs. It was first time I implemented graphs on a React APP and it was fun to learn. It fetches daily data from API 
to give number of people who have been infected of Covid-19, cured and also the deaths. 

What I learned: React, fetching data from API with axios and implementing that on a graph, user interface that changes when picking a country.
